# Titanic Dataset – Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset.  
The objective was to analyze patterns, relationships between variables, and factors affecting passenger survival.

## 📁 Dataset
- Dataset: Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)
- Contains passenger details such as age, gender, class, fare, and survival status.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Performed
- Handled missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns
- Removed or filled null values appropriately
- Converted categorical variables into usable format
- Checked for duplicates and inconsistencies

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed survival distribution
- Studied relationship between passenger class and survival
- Compared survival rate based on gender
- Explored age distribution using histograms
- Visualized correlations using charts and graphs

## 🔎 Key Insights
- Female passengers had a higher survival rate.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Age and fare showed noticeable patterns in survival probability.

## 🚀 Conclusion
This project improved my understanding of data preprocessing, visualization techniques, and identifying meaningful patterns in real-world datasets.
